## Description
  
This project will assist in creating team profiles for employers. It will create cards to showcase your employee's names, ID #s, emails, and depending on their position, either their office number, gitHub profile, or school they attend. This application is mostly powered by jQuery but has some HTML and CSS elements to develop the webpage. 

## User Story

As a manager, I want to write a team profile page, so that my team's information is showcased.
